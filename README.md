# 3x3-Home-Screen
Button Application Learning about Home Screen GUI

## Introductory Visuals

Buttons enable user initiated behaviours

Do This Not That
- illustrates how one or two buttons can cause simple visual data to happen on the screen
- Notice: if this was the entire screen, an understanding of *Stages* in a video game would be understood and begin to be programmed

Exemplar of 3x3 Home Screen Application: Tic Tac Toe
- See Student Exemplars Creativity / tic_tac_toe.pde
- Note: this exemplar would only ear 50% as a final grade since colour changes are not allowed in the project without prior discussions with Mr. Mercer

## Questions
- How can buttons control other elements?

How does V1 act that V2 does not act? (Note: you have to think outside the box and be curious)
- turns off the drawing when clicked off the button
- V2 continues to draw the last clicked button

## Expectations

Do This Not That
- Create a "Do this Not That" exemplar with one and two buttons (two programs)
  - Include text to GUI (here illustrated in an advanced way)
  - Required text code in setup, stays in setup
  - Required text code in draw is split up as needed in the subprogram
  - When needed, code is automatically copied and pasted by referencing the `void function`
- Use single-line-IF to communicate between mouse and drawing
  - notice that here Booleans are made false every time mouse is clicked
- Create another version of Do This Not That to track when Booleans are on and off
  - Uses IF ELSE
  - Notice that the behaviour changes whenever mouse is pressed

3 x 3 Home Screen
- Use Paperfolding to understand 3 by 3 chart and beginning "coordinates" (ratios)
- Students to submit case study by showing how 9 different buttons interact with each other (shapes, text, images)
- Note: exemplars demonstrate colour changes, which will not be accepted as complete
- Students will be given a lot of class time and coaching to complete this project

3 x 3 Home Screen Layout (v1-v3)
- build the spaces for each section of the home screen
- begin to group variables according to the pattern of values
- build 3 buttons in 3 spaces based on paperfolding ratios

3 x 3 Home Screen Hover Over (v4)
- add the button hover over code where needed
- difficulty is grouping code in to sections and only attending to those sections

3 x 3 Home Screen Button Pressing (v5)
- add one example of control: changing the fill of one rectangle based on 4 buttons

## Instructions, Vocabulary, & Explanations (Including URLs and IDE Use)

Do This Not That, version 1
- Single Line IF do not include {} and act like gate-keeps for single lines of code
- Booleans record program states that are read later in executable code

Do This Not That, version 2
- Using IF-ELSE code to track Boolean states

3x3 Home Screen
- Create a matrix of rectangles 3 x 3
- Put buttons in each rectangles
- When the button is clicked, it results in one of the following changes
  - adds an image to a rectangle

## Blocks of code, Emphasized Functions

This project emphasizes patterns of data coded into variables.

This project also emphasizes groups of code and methods a programmer might review these groups

*New Code can be ignored until full project is complete*

This assignment only has the addition of Advanced code in Version 6
- FOR Loop to populate variables
- Variables grouped according to Arrays ( automatic alpha-numeric )

## Specific Functions and Parameters emphasized here: TBA

## Gamification or Rubric or Points
- [1] DO This Not That has single or double buttons that work, using Booleans to transfer information between subprograms
- [1] Home Screen has 9 buttons that produce 9 different results through changing images, texts, and shapes

## Additional Information to Answer Questions

Follow Progression of Programs
- learn to draw rectangles
- create data structure for variables
- learn ratios for fullScreen()
- create button pressing code
- create hover over effect using void draw() {}
- instead of println, add effects through a Boolean Switch to void draw() {}

Advanced: group code into sections

## Extensions
- Tic Tak Toe (Intermediate Computer Science Game to study algorithms)
- See Student Exemplars Creativity / tic_tac_toe.pde
