Called READING and WRITING Arrays
- Reminder: printArray(ptX) //ptY will verify values to debug



Progressions
- Create the Array (learning trick here, similar to "wax on, wax off" or "pick up your jacket"
- Single FOR Loops
- Grouping FOR Loops that are similar (j-index is separate from i-index)
- Grouping FOR Loops that are the same, actually more difficult (j-index is included with i-index)
