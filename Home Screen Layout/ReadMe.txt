"Repetition is the Mother of Learning"

Progressions
- Scaffold a basic home screen program: learn how the ratios 
- Draw rectangles and starting points (coloured black) & other points (coloured red)



Ideas
- Point Population introduces FOR Loops and BIG O Notation (Run times)
- Points are named with Alpha-Numeric Notation introducing very simple arrays (data structure)
- Points form number patterns called COMPUTATIONAL THINKING, logic and arithmetic
  "How a computer thinks."
- 




Layout the different points and start to draw rectangles from them

Purpose is to know the dimensions of the rectangles from the different points, not pixels on the screen
